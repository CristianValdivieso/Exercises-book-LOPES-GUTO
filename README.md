# Exercises-book-LOPES-GUTO
 
In this repository, you will find almost **500 exercises** of the book *Introdução à Programação: 500 algoritmos resolvidos* :books:.<br>

The authors (**Anita Lopes and Guto Garcia**) do not use JavaScript as the main language of the book. So, here I reproduced the content in JS language to help for a better understanding to people that are in the beginning of learning JS.<br> 

Notice that many of the exercises have different ways to be solved. Use this material to complement your learning. I hope it will be useful :blush:
